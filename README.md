# Image-Super-Resolution-using-GANs
We have implemented a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to enhance real-world images by improving their resolution, sharpness, detail, and color balance. Our approach leverages adversarial training to generate high-fidelity images with fine textures and realistic enhancements, ensuring superior visual quality.
